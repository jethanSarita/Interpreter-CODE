# this is a sample program in CODE
BEGIN CODE
	INT x, y, z = 5
	CHAR a_1 = ’n’
	BOOL t = ”TRUE”
	x = y = 4
	a_1 = ’c’
	# this is a comment
	DISPLAY: x & t & z & $ & a_1 & [#] & “last”
END CODE

Something to note is that both line 5 and line 9 use '""' but is denoted as
different datatypes, line 5 is a boolean while line 9 is a string
even though string datatypes is not mentioned in ma'am's given documentation

I think we should just make TRUE and FALSE keywords without the need of '""'
